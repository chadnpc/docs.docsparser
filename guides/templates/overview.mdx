## What are templates?

Templates in **DocsParser** are predefined schemas designed to simplify data extraction for common document types such as invoices, bank statements and more.

Instead of creating a custom schema for each document, you can leverage templates to get started quickly.

Each template is a JSON schema tailored to a specific document type. When using a template, DocsParser automatically applies the associated schema to extract structured data from your document.

**Why Use Templates?**

1. **Quick Start**: Save time by using ready-made schemas instead of designing one from scratch.
2. **Consistency**: Ensure uniform data extraction across similar document types.
3. **Community Contribution**: Access a growing library of templates contributed by other users.

## Available Templates

Currently, there are three templates available but we'll be adding more in the future.

- **Invoice**: Extracts details like invoice numbers, billing information, item details, and total amounts.
- **Bank Statement**: Extracts transaction details, account numbers, and balances.
- **Drivers License (UK)**: Extracts details like drivers name, address, license number, issuing authority, and expiration date.

## How to Use Templates

To use a template, simply pass the template name in the `extract` function:

```javascript
import { extract } from 'docsparser';

const result = await extract({
  file: 'https://example.com/document.pdf',
  template: 'invoice', // Specify the template name
});

console.log(result);
```
