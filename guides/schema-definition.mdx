## What is a schema?

A schema in DocsParser defines the structure of data to be extracted from a document. Think of it as a blueprint or template that guides the extraction process to retrieve the correct information in the desired format.

### What can a schema do?

Schemas are used to:

- Define the fields to extract.
- Specify the type of data for each field (e.g., `string`, `number`, `array`, `enum`, `boolean`).
- Set the relationships between fields (e.g., nested arrays or objects).

## Defining a Schema

In DocsParser, a schema is defined as an array of objects, each representing a field to be extracted. Each field object includes the following properties:

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  A unique identifier for the field.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="description" type="string" required>
  A brief explanation of what the field represents.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="type" type="enum" required>
  The type of data. Options are: `string`, `number`, `array`, `object`, `enum`, `boolean`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="values" type="string[]">
  Used when the field type is `enum`, to specify available options.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="children" type="object[]">
  Nested fields for `array` or `object` types.
</ResponseField>


## Example Schema

Here’s an example schema for a **bank statement**:

```javascript Bank statement schema
const schema = [
  {
    name: "accountNumber",
    type: "string",
    description: "The account number of the bank statement."
  },
  {
    name: "openingBalance",
    type: "number",
    description: "The opening balance of the account."
  },
  {
    name: "transactions",
    type: "array",
    description: "List of transactions in the account.",
    children: [
      {
        name: "date",
        type: "string",
        description: "Transaction date."
      },
      {
        name: "creditAmount",
        type: "number",
        description: "Credit Amount of the transaction."
      },
      {
        name: "debitAmount",
        type: "number",
        description: "Debit Amount of the transaction."
      },
      {
        name: "description",
        type: "string",
        description: "Transaction description."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    name: "closingBalance",
    type: "number",
    description: "The closing balance of the account."
  },
  {
    name: "highValueAccount",
    type: "boolean",
    description: "Closing balance is more than 50000 ."
  },
  {
    name: "statementType",
    type: "enum",
    description: "The type of document",
    values: ["Current Account", "Savings Account"]
  }
]
