<Tab title="API">
Here's how to extract data from a document using the API:

Start by calling the endpoint to create an extraction job.
Pass in the file URL along with your schema.

```bash Create a job
curl  -X POST \
'https://api.docsparser.is-cool.dev/run-job' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer docsparser_API_KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
"file": "https://example.com/bank-statement.pdf"
"schema": [*/Your schema here/*]
}'
```
The response will include the job ID, which you can use with the next endpoint to check the status and retrieve the results of your extraction.

```bash Create a job
curl  -X GET \
'https://api.docsparser.is-cool.dev/job/{id}' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer docsparser_API_KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```
