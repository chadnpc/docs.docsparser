title: 'Rate Limits'
---

The DocsParser API is rate-limited to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse. Rate limits are applied on a per-account basis, with a set number of requests allowed within a fixed time window.

Users on higher-tier plans enjoy increased rate limits. If the limit is exceeded, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
